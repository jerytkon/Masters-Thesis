# Pro-Gradu

In my Masters' Thesis in Economics I analysed the possible impact of Brexit on United Kngdoms' imports of Bovine meat.
In order to estimate the impact a time series model for import demand was constructed with the use of RStudio. 
The code that I used for import demand estimation is in this repositiory as well as the excel files.

The files used for the Masters Thesis can be found from src folder.
The Data file contains the code for importing the data into R and transforming it into a usable format.
The tests and model file contains the code that was used to conduct the necessary econometric tests and the building the ARDL-ECM model.
